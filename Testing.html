	<p>What is scrum and how does it work</p>
	<p style="color:white;"> <font> 
		Scrum is a framework used for product development. Assume company has 10 products and 2 product owners. Each product owner is responsible for 5 products and they planned every sprint for 2 weeks.
Consider the first product enhancement is planned. Product owner explains 2 high level requirements from his product backlog. Scrum team (scrum master, Dev , SQA, implementation, DB team) reviews this and break down into many user stories.
Tuesday onwards, daily 1 meeting is scheduled which is called as “stand up call” and in that people says what I achieved so far, what is planning for today. And what are the main issues which are blocking me.
If any stand up call produces any shippable product that can be planned to move to production immediately. Sometimes Sprint review with all interested parties may occur.
If both of the requirements are fulfilled by covering all user stories, then next spring planning session can happen on following day to add new requirements.
If any one of the requirement cannot be fulfilled in 1st sprint and that will be discussed in subsequent stand up call, product owner can put that requirement back to Product backlog.
Scrum is a framework for Agile testing. Some companies uses scrum for innovation process as well where employees only creates the product backlog and start working for it.
